# Image-into-Cartoon
This repository provides a Python script that converts an input image into a cartoon-style image using OpenCV. The script applies several image processing techniques, including grayscale conversion, median blurring, edge detection, and bilateral filtering, to achieve a cartoonish effect while preserving the details and edges of the original image.
